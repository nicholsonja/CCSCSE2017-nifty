    <h1>Converting PPM to SVG</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        The PPM format is a bitmap format for images.  It contains data that
        defines the height and width of an image in pixels,
        and then contains information that defines
        the color of every pixel.  The SVG format is a vector format for images.
        Rather than defining individual pixels, it defines shapes - their sizes,
        paths, coordinates and colors.  In this assignment,
        you will convert PPM images to SVG, changing the way they look
        and making them a little more artistic.
    </p>
    <h2>PPM File Format</h2>
    <p>
        The PPM format is fairly straightforward.  Below you see the beginning
        of an example PPM file:
    </p>
    <blockquote><code>
    P3<br>
    100 83<br>
    255<br>
    255 0 0<br>
    255 255 128<br>
    0 0 100<br>
    50 42 130<br>
    ...
    </code></blockquote>
    <p>
        The <code>P3</code> means this is a PPM file.  The next line contains the width and the height.
        In this case, this image will have a width of 100 pixels and a height of 83 pixels.
        The third line, which has the lone <code>255</code>, means that the data in the file
        will contain integers in the range 0 to 255.
    </p>
    <p>
        The remaining lines are the color data for each pixel.  Because this image is 100x83,
        there will be 8300 lines in the file after the first 3 header lines.
        
        Each line represents
        one pixel, and the first pixel, that is the first triplet, is the pixel in
        the upper left corner of the image, and the next pixels moves across the row.
        When the row is finished the next value will start the next line.
    </p>
    <p>
        The line for each pixel will have three integers in the range 0 to 255, which is
        the RGB color value for the pixel.  The first integer represents the
        red (R) channel, the second integer represents the green (G) channel, and the third integer represents
        the blue (B) channel. 0 means that channel
        is turned completely off, 255 means it is completely on, and
        any value in between the color is turned on part way. Example colors would be:
        <code>0 0 0</code> is black, <code>255 255 255</code> is white,
        and <code>255 0 0</code> is red.
    </p>
    <h2>SVG File Format</h2>
    <p>
      The SVG file format is used for vector images, which
      are images that you can zoom in infinitely without pixelization.
      It is more complex than the PPM format, but with that complexity comes
      a lot of flexibility, which allows us to create complex images
      rather easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is very important that you read this format closely.  If you leave out
      just one symbol or type the wrong letter, your file may not work.
      Be careful about adding extra spaces, even those can corrupt your
      SVG file.  For example, <code>&lt;/svg&gt;</code> is correct,
      but both <code>&lt; /svg&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/ svg&gt;</code>
      are incorrect because of the extra space added to each one.
      The details in this format are important.
   </p>
   <h3>First Line</h3>
   <p>
      The first line of an SVG file has the <code>svg</code> start tag, which looks like this
   </p>
   <blockquote><code>
      &lt;svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='600' height='600' version='1.1'&gt;
   </code></blockquote>
   <p>
      Everything needs to be there. The &lt;, the &gt;, the single quote, and so on.
      The values for width and height can change.  
   </p>
   
   <h3>Last Line</h3>
   <p>
      The last line of an SVG file has the <code>svg</code> end tag, which is simply:
   </p>
   <blockquote><code>
      &lt;/svg&gt;
   </code></blockquote>
   <p>
      That's it. That's all.  Nothing else.      
   </p>
   
   <h3>Shapes</h3>
   <p>
      All the lines for the shapes go between the <code>svg</code> start tag
      and the <code>svg</code> end tag.  Three basic shapes that we will support are
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>Circles</li>
      <li>Squares</li>
      <li>Triangles</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
      The SVG coordinate system places (0,0) in the top-left corner of the
      page.  As you move right, x increases.  As you move down, y increases.
   </p>
   
   <h4>Circles</h4>
   <p>
      A circle is generated with the <code>circle</code> tag, which looks like this:
   </p>
   <blockquote><code>
      &lt;circle cx='250' cy='250' r='50'  fill='rgb(0,0,255)' /&gt;
   </code></blockquote>
   <p>
      where
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>cx and cy are the center coordinates for the circle</li>
      <li>r is the radius</li>
      <li>fill is the color in rgb notation</li>
   </ul>
   
   <h4>Squares</h4>
   <p>
      A square is generated with the <code>rect</code> tag, which looks like this:
   </p>
   <blockquote><code>
      &lt;rect x='200' y='400' height='100' width='100'  fill=''rgb(100,0,2)' /&gt;
   </code></blockquote>
   <p>
      where
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>x and y are the coordinates of the upper-left corner of the square</li>
      <li>height and width are the size of the rectangle. Obviously for a square they should have the same value</li>
      <li>fill is the color in rgb notation</li>
   </ul>
   
   
   <h4>Triangles</h4>
   <p>
      There is no triangle tag in the SVG format.
      Instead, we use the general-purpose <code>polygon</code> tag, which looks like this:
   </p>
   <blockquote><code>
      &lt;polygon points='300,500 400,500 350,600'  fill='rgb(0,0,0)' /&gt;
   </code></blockquote>
   <p>
      where
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>
         points is a series of (x,y) coordinate pairs.
         <ul>
            <li>Each x and y is separated by a comma.  </li>
            <li>Each (x,y) pair is separated by a single space. </li>
            <li>
               Do not add extra spaces, otherwise the polygon will be incorrect.
               For example, in the example above, it would be incorrect to output
               <blockquote><code>
                  &lt;polygon points='300,      500 400,500 350,600'  fill='rgb(0,0,0)' /&gt;
               </code></blockquote>
               for the first (x,y) pair.  There should not be any spaces on either side of the commas.
            </li>
         </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
         fill is the color in RGB notation
      </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
      You can create other polygons with the <code>polygon</code> tag, just
      add additional points to the <code>points</code> attribute.
   </p>

   <h3>Colors</h3>
   <p>
      SVG colors are based on the RGB model, just like the PPM format.
      Colors are made by combining red, blue, and green values.
      In order to define a color, use <code>rgb(r, g, b)</code>
      where r, g, and b are integer values that
      can range from 0 up to and including 255.   Some examples:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>white:   		   <code>rgb(255,255,255)</code></li>
      <li>red:   		      <code>rgb(255,0,0)</code></li>
      <li>green:		      <code>rgb(0,255,0)</code></li>
      <li>blue:		      <code>rgb(0,0,255)</code></li>
      <li>dark sea green:	<code>rgb(143, 188, 143)</code></li>
      <li>slate blue:	   <code>rgb(106, 90, 205)</code></li>
      <li>black:		      <code>rgb(0, 0, 0)</code></li>
   </ul>

   <h3>SVG Sample</h3>
   <p>
      Here is a small example of a complete SVG file
      with two triangles, one circle and one square.
   </p>
   <blockquote><code>
      &lt;svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='600' height='600' version='1.1'&gt;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;polygon points='0,300 300,300 150,0'  fill='rgb(0,0,255)' /&gt;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;circle cx='450' cy='150' r='150'  fill='rgb(128,68,250)' /&gt;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;rect x='0' y='300' height='300' width='300'  fill='rgb(50, 255, 50)' /&gt;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;polygon points='300,300 600,300, 450,600'  fill='rgb(0,0,0)' /&gt;<br>
      &lt;/svg>
   </code></blockquote>

   <h3>Converting bitmaps to vector</h3>
   <p>
      There are many ways to convert bitmap images, PPM in our case, to vector images,
      SVG for us. For our conversion, we will convert one pixel at a time to some SVG output.
      One way to think about a pixel is to think of it as a 1x1 square.  When we convert that
      square to a vector we will still have a square, but it doesn't have to be 1x1.  In
      our SVG images, we can make that square any size, for example, 10x10.
   </p>
   <p>
      That 10x10 in the SVG image isn't a pixel, it is a box, actually a <em>bounding box</em>.
      We can draw whatever we want in that bounding box to represent a converted pixel.  Maybe
      we draw a circle with a radius of 5 centered in the middle of the box.
      We could also draw a square inside the box, but make the square 8x8.  That would mean there
      is a little bit of padding between the square we draw and the edge of the bounding box.
   </p>
   <p>
      We don't actually draw the bounding box.  It is simply the limits of where we can draw something
      for a single, converted pixel.  Each pixel from the original PPM file has its own bounding box.
   </p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>
        You have been given several PPM files.  Your code should prompt the user for three
        pieces of information:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The name of the PPM file to read.</li>
      <li>Output shape: circle, square, or triangle.</li>
      <li>The type of conversions: color or black and white.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Once your program has this information, it should open the requested
      PPM file and prepare the output file <code>art.svg</code>.  Your code
      should read each pixel in the PPM file and convert it to the appropriate
      SVG shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      When determining the width and height of your SVG file, use a
      bounding box size of 10.  That means you should take the height
      and width of the PPM file and multiply it by 10.
    </p>
    <h3>Output</h3>
    <p>
      Each pixel will be converted to one of three shapes and colored
      one of two ways.
    </p>
    <h4>Colored output</h4>
    <p>
      If the user requested color, you will output the shape
      with the same color as the pixel in the PPM file.  For example,
      if the PPM file has a pixel with the RGB color
    </p>
    <blockquote><code>
      10 255 78
    </code></blockquote>
    <p>
      and the user had requested you to output the shape circle and
      make the conversion colored, your SVG file would contain this line:
    </p>
    <blockquote><code>&lt;circle cx='5' cy='5' r='5'  fill='rgb(10,255,78)' /&gt;</code></blockquote>
    <p>
      although the values for <code>cx</code> and <code>cy</code> would change
      depending on the (x, y) value of the pixel in the PPM file.  The radius is 5
      since the bounding box is 10x10.
    </p>
    <p>
      To see an example of this output, take a look at
      <a href="colorCircle_butterfly.svg" target="_blank">colorCircle_butterfly.svg</a>
    </p>
    <h4>Black and white output</h4>
    <p>
      If the user requested black and white output, you will convert
      each pixel's color to grayscale using the formula
      <code>gray = (red + green + blue) / 3</code>.
      Once you have this value, you will use it to scale the size of
      the shape.  Basically, the closer the value <code>gray</code> is
      to 0 the larger the shape and the closer the value is to 255 the
      smaller to shape.  If the value is 0, then the shape should fit entirely
      within its bounding box.  If the value is 255, then the shape would
      invisible, that is no size (if you want to make you files smaller,
      don't output any shape that has a gray value equal to 0).
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, suppose a pixel had the color
    </p>
    <blockquote><code>
      153 51 255
    </code></blockquote>
    <p>
      and the user had requested a black and white circle conversion.
      First we convert the PPM color to gray:
    </p>
    <blockquote><code>(153 + 51 + 255) / 3 = 459 / 3 = 153.0 = gray</code></blockquote>
    <p>
      next we scale the circle's radius since that is used to size
      circles in the SVH file.  If we use a bounding box size of 10, then a circle
      that would completely fill the box would have a radius of 5.  Using that,
      we can compute the radius of the circle based on the value of <code>gray</code>:
    </p>
    <blockquote><code>(255 - 153)/255 * 5 = 102/255 * 4 = 0.4 * 5 = 2.0</code></blockquote>
    <p>
      Since we want the color black, we use the color <code>rgb(0,0,0)</code>.  The final
      result for the circle would be:
    </p>
    <blockquote><code>&lt;circle cx='5' cy='5' r='2.0'  fill='rgb(0,0,0)' /&gt;</code></blockquote>
    <p>
