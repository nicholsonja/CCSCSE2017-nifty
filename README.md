This is a collection of samples for the Nifty assignment "Converting PPM images to SVG images: a nifty assignment" 
at the 2017 CCSC:SE Conference to be held at Furman University November 3-4, 2017. 

The **source_images** folder contains the original images downloaded from the internet (attribution can be found in the folder). 
These files are often SVG images or large images that don't work well with the PPM/SVG assignment.  Therefore, the source files 
are converted to the images in **original_images** folder. Large images are scaled down and the original SVG images are exported 
as small PNG images.  The **original_images** are used to create the PPM files for the students.
